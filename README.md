# odin-recipes
This repository was my first 'real' project thus far into 'The Odin Project'. My firs project was to create a Recipe Site, with a main page,and 3 pages of my 'favourite' recipes. This goal of this exercise was to use, all the techniques/course material that was covered thus far. E.g writing a Html boiler plate, using headings(and the different sizes), using paragraphs, images, anchor references(links), atomic commit using git, git messages for committing, ordered and unordered lists. Using CLI instructions to create and move files through the directory, pulling a repo from gitHub. All and all I feel that this was a very fun project, and I am quite proud of my effort, and the skills I have applied in this project.I am also quite happy with my ability to remember the course contents, and not constantly looking for hand holding material. I look forward to the future projects and what other skills I can learn. Per Ardua Ad Astra
